# Digital Business Card

This solo project is a part of Scrimba's Frontend Developer Career Path.

## Overview

I started from setting up my files and moved on to plan out components and files. Then I rendered all the HTML with ReactDOM.render() and styled it.

## Built with
* HTML5 markup
* CSS
* React

## What I learned
I learned the basics of React: what JSX is, how to create and organise components, import and export things between files, how to style my HTML with className, and how to set up my projects locally!

## Continued development
I will keep learning React to create reusable, interactive apps.
