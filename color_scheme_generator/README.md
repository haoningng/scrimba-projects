# Color Scheme Generator

This solo project is a part of Scrimba's Frontend Developer Career Path.

## Overview

The goal was to create a color scheme generator that uses The Color API. When the user chooses the color and the color scheme, a color palette will be generated.

In this project, I was given a design file which I should follow when creating CSS. I began by analyzing the design and setting up the HTML structure. After that, I wrote the CSS and JavaScript. This was my first time working with API on my own, so I also spent some time on analyzing The Color API's documentation.
