# Travel Journal

This solo project is a part of Scrimba's Frontend Developer Career Path.

## Overview

This was my second React solo project. The goal was to create a travel journal app that renders cards from imported data and displays them on the page. This project is supposed to be done alone from the scratch.

I started from setting up my files and moved on to plan out components and files. I created a card component and my own data file. Then I used props to map the data into every card. Then I rendered all the HTML with ReactDOM.render() and styled it.

## What I learned
I have practiced using props, creating reusable components, and using React. I also got to play around with media queries and CSS, which allowed me to personalize the page and make it responsive.
